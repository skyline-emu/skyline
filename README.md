We've used Ryujinx throughout the project for reference, the amount of accuracy of their HLE kernel implementation is what makes them such an amazing reference. In addition, the team behind the project has been really helpful with any queries we had.

We've extensively used Switchbrew whether that be their [wiki](https://switchbrew.org/) with it's collosal amount of information on the Switch that has saved us countless hours of time or [libnx](https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx) which was crucial to initial development of the emulator to ensure that our implementations were correct.
